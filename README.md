A comprehensive portal for hackathons where students can submit their work and judges can evaluate in one place.


###  Key Features

-    User on-boarding for 3 types of users: Organizers, Judges, and Hackers
-    Showing a clear rubric for judges
-    Organizers can assign judges to certain projects
-    Judges can easily review and assign scores to submissions
-    Easy way for hackers to submit projects
-    Organizers can create a hackathon event
-    Judges can sign onto/accept an assigned project

##  Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

-    React: Valuable for its speed, economy of code, and the team is already familiar with it.
-    Redux: Temporary, but advanced state management, better for scaleable projects.
-    Material UI: Implements a seamless way to integrate features such as, calendars or clocks to select dates and time.
-    Sass: Facilitates clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct.

#### Front end deployed to `netlify.com`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/hackathon-portal-be) built using:

-    Node is lightweight, efficient, and its ability to use JavaScript on both frontend and backend opens new avenues for development. 
-    Express simplifies development and makes it easier to write secure, modular and fast applications.
-    PostgreSQL is a powerful data management system while being both free and open source.
-    Heroku is a "polyglot platform" and is commonly understood by various other programing languages.

# APIs

##  Authentication API

The data API is deployed on heroku and not for personal use

#  Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  DB_ENV - this is your database URL.
    *  BACKEND_API - the URL for the backend deoployment.

#  Testing

ðŸš«Document what you used for testing and why

#  Installation Instructions

Run npm i and then npm start to get a development server running.

# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Issue/Bug Request
   
 **If you are having an issue with the existing project code, please submit a bug report under the following guidelines:**
 - Check first to see if your issue has already been reported.
 - Check to see if the issue has recently been fixed by attempting to reproduce the issue using the latest master branch in the repository.
 - Create a live example of the problem.
 - Submit a detailed bug report including your environment & browser, steps to reproduce the issue, actual and expected outcomes,  where you believe the issue is originating from, and any potential solutions you have considered.

### Feature Requests

The judge feature needs to be fully realized. Currently the backend is setup to handle judges by means of roles assigned to the user on the front end.
Our thoughts for handling this would be to change the "Add Organizer" button in the "Hackathon Details" page to a"Add Organizer/Judge" button. Then when you selected a user on the "User List" page, you could chose to add the user as an organizer or a judge. 
(Look in the release canvas section of the Notion doc for more information.)

Upon completion of this feature we would like to add a rubric system for judges to utilize so that ratings could better be understood and distributed. 

### Pull Requests

If you have developed a patch, bug fix, or new feature that would improve this app, please submit a pull request. It is best to communicate your ideas with the developers first before investing a great deal of time into a pull request to ensure that it will mesh smoothly with the project.

Remember that this project is licensed under the MIT license, and by submitting a pull request, you agree that your work will be, too.

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new plist variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
- Ensure that your code conforms to our existing code conventions and test coverage.
- Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
